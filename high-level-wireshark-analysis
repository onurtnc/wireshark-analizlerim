Advanced Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis Report
1. Executive Summary

This report presents an advanced network traffic analysis conducted using
Wireshark on a captured PCAP file. The objective of the analysis was to identify
abnormal network behavior, focusing on DNS and HTTP traffic patterns that may
indicate automated or malicious activity such as command-and-control (C2)
communication.

The analysis revealed repetitive DNS queries with regular time intervals,
suggesting beaconing behavior commonly associated with malware callbacks.

2. Scope & Objectives
Scope

Analysis of DNS and HTTP traffic

Identification of anomalous communication patterns

Correlation of network indicators with SOC detection logic

Objectives

Detect automated network behavior

Distinguish malicious traffic from normal user activity

Provide actionable findings for SOC investigation and response

3. Environment & Tools

Tool Used: Wireshark

Data Source: PCAP network capture

Protocols Analyzed: DNS, HTTP, TCP

Analysis Perspective: Defensive / SOC-focused

4. Methodology

The analysis followed a structured SOC-style approach:

Initial traffic overview and protocol distribution

Focused filtering on DNS traffic

Frequency and timing analysis of DNS queries

Inspection of HTTP requests following DNS resolution

Identification of automation indicators

5. Traffic Analysis Findings
5.1 DNS Traffic Analysis

Observations:

A single internal host generated a high volume of DNS queries

Queries targeted the same external domain repeatedly

Requests occurred at consistent time intervals

Domain names appeared non-descriptive and low reputation

Indicators Identified:

Repetitive queries (high frequency)

Regular query timing (automation)

Lack of diversity in queried domains

These indicators strongly suggest DNS beaconing behavior rather than normal
human-generated traffic.

5.2 HTTP Traffic Analysis

Following DNS resolution, HTTP traffic was observed originating from the same
host:

Repeated HTTP GET requests

Minimal variation in request headers

Absence of typical browser behavior patterns

This behavior supports the hypothesis of command-and-control communication
using application-layer protocols.

6. Timing & Pattern Analysis

A time-based analysis of DNS queries revealed:

Consistent intervals between requests

No correlation with user interaction patterns

Predictable request frequency

This regularity is a strong indicator of automated malware activity rather than
legitimate application behavior.

7. Threat Assessment
Likely Threat Type

Malware beaconing / C2 communication

Potential Impact

Remote command execution

Data exfiltration

Persistent unauthorized access

8. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
Tactic	Technique	Description
Command and Control	DNS (T1071.004)	DNS used for C2 communication
Command and Control	Application Layer Protocol	HTTP used for callback traffic
9. Recommended SOC Actions

Investigate the affected endpoint using EDR telemetry

Identify the process responsible for DNS and HTTP traffic

Isolate the host if malicious activity is confirmed

Block the suspicious domain at DNS or firewall level

Initiate incident response procedures

10. Conclusion

The analyzed network traffic exhibits multiple characteristics consistent with
automated command-and-control beaconing activity. The combination of repetitive
DNS queries, regular timing, and follow-up HTTP requests strongly indicates
malicious behavior.

This analysis demonstrates how Wireshark can be effectively used to support SOC
operations by providing packet-level evidence for detection, investigation, and
incident response workflows.

11. Analyst Notes

This report was created as part of a SOC-focused learning and portfolio project
to demonstrate advanced PCAP analysis, detection logic, and security-oriented
reporting.
